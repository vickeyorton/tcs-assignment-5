      "description": "Fried rice is one of those dishes you can whip up after a busy day when you don’t know what else to make. Everyone loves it. It is eaten throughout Asia, and this is our play on it, bringing in the much-loved kimchi flavours. It’s a great way to use up leftover cooked rice, and feel free to add any extra vegetables you may have in your fridge. There are so many versions of sauteed chicken with sauce, but this bourbon chicken is one of my favorite iterations of that idea. It’s easy to make, flexible enough to use any cut of chicken you have on hand (use cubed thighs or breast), and the bourbon sauce is so good you’ll want to eat it with a spoon straight out of the skillet.The trick to making this dish the best it can be is by making sure you have plenty of sauce. You want it to coat the chicken and have more than enough to drizzle over the rice as well.This recipe isn’t booze forward despite the name. The alcohol in the bourbon completely cooks off as the sauce simmers and it’s safe to serve to children, but if you are concerned or don’t have bourbon on hand, you can substitute the 1/4 cup of bourbon for 1/4 cup of hoisin sauce.Hoisin sauce is a sweet and tangy sauce typically used in Asian cuisine, that is available at most grocery stores. It thickens nicely and would work well in this dish.",
